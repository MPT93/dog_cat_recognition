CATS AND DOGS RECOGNITION ALGORITHM
This project contains algorithm to classify whether images show either a dog or a cat.The algorithm is based on CNN MobileNet model and transfer learning. 
Data to train and test the model was collected from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data.  
This project involved following steps:
- creating image data generator with data augmentation and preprocessing, 
- loading the data from a directory,
- data visualizaton,
- creating the model with pretrained MobileNet network and extra four fully connected layers,
- building and training the model,
- evaluation of the model.
